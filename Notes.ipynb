    "# Tabulated Equation of State Support\n",
    "\n",
    "In this repository we will be giving `IllinoisGRMHD` tabulated equation of state (TEOS) support. Our numerical experiments indicate that to achieve the best results with the conservative-to-primitive (con2prim) routine we are using, we should also evolve the entropy $S$ along with the other GRMHD quantities.\n",

    "This is a new thorn, inteded to be used alongside neutron star initial data thorns, such as `NRPyPlusTOVID` and `Meudon_Bin_NS`. The idea is that these initial data thorns, which have been successfully used with `IllinoisGRMHD` in the past, set some of the `HydroBase` thorn quantities but not all of them. Therefore, this thorn provides initial data capabilities for $Y_{\\rm e}$, $T$, and $S$, in a concise, modular, and flexible fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing the thorn, care was taken so that we could add maximum flexibility at the parameter file level, allowing the thorn to work with many different types of initial data, as we briefly describe now.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the functions in this thorn are invoked, we expect that the `HydroBase` variables $rho_{\\rm HB}$ and $v^{i}_{\\rm HB}$ to have already been set. The thorn will not modify the velocities. We then set $Y_{e}$, $T$, and $S$, allowing the following possiblities. The initialization options for these variables are as follows.\n",

    "  1. $T$ read from a file. The file should contain $T(\\left(\\rho\\right)$. Typically this is normally used for constant entropy initial data.\n",
