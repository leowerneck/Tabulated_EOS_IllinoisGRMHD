    "There are different approaches for including neutrino effects in the coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS). For example, the observation that simulations typically model $\\mathcal{O}(10)$ ms of the merging event can lead one to assume that transport effects by the difussion of neutrinos are of minor importance, with negligible neutrino momentum transfers. These are the core assumptions made by [Ruffert *et al.* (1996)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/pdf/1996A%26A...311..532R) (see also [O'Connor & Ott (2010)](https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2393), [Galleazi *et al.* (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4953), [Siegel & Metzger (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00868), and [Murguia-Berthier *et al.* (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05356)), where neutrino physics are included via a *neutrino leakage scheme*.\n",

    "A neutrino leakage scheme takes into account possible equilibrations of neutrinos and the opaque, hot stellar matter to describe local neutrino sinks and sources. These, in turn, lead to variations in the number of leptons, which result in heating or cooling of the system. There is a variety of neutrino emission mechanisms that are important at different densities and temperatures within nuclear matter. The most important of them are (i) electron and positron capture on nucleons ([$\\beta$-process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_decay)); (ii) [electron-positron pair annihilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation); (iii) transverse plasmon decay. We now provide an overview of these reactions, while details of how to compute the neutrino emission rates are postponed until [Step 1.b.i](#neutrino_rates) below.\n",
