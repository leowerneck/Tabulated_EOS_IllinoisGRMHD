1. Purpose

This thorn constructs Fishbone-Moncrief accretion
disk initial data, within a Kerr-Schild spinning
black hole spacetime.

2. Documentation

Full documentation may be found in the NRPy+
Jupyter notebook tutorial modules:
* Tutorial-FishboneMoncriefID.ipynb and
* Tutorial-ETK_thorn-FishboneMoncriefID.ipynb ,

Both of the above notebooks are located in the
doc/ directory,

The notebooks also generate clickable LaTeX'ed versions
   of themselves, and compile the LaTeX into PDFs.

3. Example parameter file

An example parameter file may be found in parfile_examples/

4. Note on automatic code generation

This thorn is automatically generated by running the
   Tutorial-ETK_thorn-FishboneMoncriefID.ipynb within
   NRPy+, which is also BSD 2-Clause licensed:

5. Special acknowledgement

Thanks to Brendan Drachler for spotting and fixing
a bug in an earlier release, and to Steve Brandt &
Roland Haas for code review and additional suggestions.
