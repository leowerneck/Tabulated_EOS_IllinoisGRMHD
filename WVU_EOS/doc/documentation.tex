%  Cactus Thorn template for ThornGuide documentation
%  Author: Ian Kelley
%  Date: Sun Jun 02, 2002
%  $Header$                                                             
%
%  Thorn documentation in the latex file doc/documentation.tex 
%  will be included in ThornGuides built with the Cactus make system.
%  The scripts employed by the make system automatically include 
%  pages about variables, parameters and scheduling parsed from the 
%  relevent thorn CCL files.
%  
%  This template contains guidelines which help to assure that your     
%  documentation will be correctly added to ThornGuides. More 
%  information is available in the Cactus UsersGuide.
%                                                    
%  Guidelines:
%   - Do not change anything before the line
%       % START CACTUS THORNGUIDE",
%     except for filling in the title, author, date etc. fields.
%        - Each of these fields should only be on ONE line.
%        - Author names should be sparated with a \\ or a comma
%   - You can define your own macros are OK, but they must appear after
%     the START CACTUS THORNGUIDE line, and do not redefine standard 
%     latex commands.
%   - To avoid name clashes with other thorns, 'labels', 'citations', 
%     'references', and 'image' names should conform to the following 
%     convention:          
%       ARRANGEMENT_THORN_LABEL
%     For example, an image wave.eps in the arrangement CactusWave and 
%     thorn WaveToyC should be renamed to CactusWave_WaveToyC_wave.eps
%   - Graphics should only be included using the graphix package. 
%     More specifically, with the "includegraphics" command. Do
%     not specify any graphic file extensions in your .tex file. This 
%     will allow us (later) to create a PDF version of the ThornGuide
%     via pdflatex. |
%   - References should be included with the latex "bibitem" command. 
%   - use \begin{abstract}...\end{abstract} instead of \abstract{...}
%   - For the benefit of our Perl scripts, and for future extensions, 
%     please use simple latex.     
%
% *======================================================================* 
% 
% Example of including a graphic image:
%    \begin{figure}[ht]
%       \begin{center}
%          \includegraphics[width=6cm]{MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyFigure}
%       \end{center}
%       \caption{Illustration of this and that}
%       \label{MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyLabel}
%    \end{figure}
%
% Example of using a label:
%   \label{MyArrangement_MyThorn_MyLabel}
%
% Example of a citation:
%    \cite{MyArrangement_MyThorn_Author99}
%
% Example of including a reference
%   \bibitem{MyArrangement_MyThorn_Author99}
%   {J. Author, {\em The Title of the Book, Journal, or periodical}, 1 (1999), 
%   1--16. {\tt http://www.nowhere.com/}}

% Add an abstract for this thorn's documentation
\begin{abstract}
When using tabulated (nuclear) EOS with the GRMHD evolution
thorn {\tt IllinoisGRMHD}, we often need to compute derivatives
of certain thermodynamics quantities. To compute said derivatives,
we need to use table interpolators. Unfortunately, the
{\tt EOS\_Omni} interpolators often compute a plethora of
unnecessary quantities alongside the ones we actually want.

This thorn was designed to remove the billions and billions
of interpolations which are computed unnecessarily during
production runs.
