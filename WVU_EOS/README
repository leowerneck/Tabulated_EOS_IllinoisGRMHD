Cactus Code Thorn WVU_EOS
Author(s)    : Leonardo R. Werneck
Note         : Build from a modified version of EOS_Omni,
               this thorn provides EOS calls for the WVU
               thorns which are more efficient and more
               suitable for our needs.

1. Purpose

When using tabulated (nuclear) EOS with the GRMHD evolution
thorn IllinoisGRMHD, we often need to compute derivatives
of certain thermodynamics quantities. To compute said derivatives,
we need to use table interpolators. Unfortunately, the EOS_Omni
interpolators often compute a plethora of unnecessary quantities
alongside the ones we actually want.

This thorn was designed to remove the billions and billions
of interpolations which are computed unnecessarily during
production runs.
